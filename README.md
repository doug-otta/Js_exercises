# Js_exercises

## INTRO
At this repo, you can find some exercises in JavaScript, very simple to solve!

## FOLLOW THE CHANNEL - CURSO EM VÍDEO - GUSTAVO GUANABARA
I used the exercises made by Gustavo Guanabara, he's a brazilian youtuber and have fantastic courses! The exercises was structured for Python, but I adapted to JavaScript, using a little bit
of CSS and HTML to show the result at the web.
And seriouly, I just solved the exercises of my own knowledge, i don't worried about the best practices of JavaScript, or CSS or HTML.

## PASTE COMPOSITION
The paste is composed by 3 archives
- HTML = the structure of the exercises.
- CSS = a little bit of CSS, because just the HTML the web page is become weird :))
- JavaScript = without this, the repo is doesn't make sense ;)

## EXERCISES
- 01: HELLO WORLD : Input your name, click in the button and the message is: "Olá! Muito prazer em te conhecer (string inputed) ";
- 02: SUM: Input two numbers (n1 and n2), click in the button "Calcular". The message appear will be: "A soma entre (n1) e (n2) é (res = n1 + n2);
- 03: TYPEOF: input anything the return will be the type of the input;
- 04: PREDECESSOR AND SUCESSOR: input a number and the return will be predecessor and successor;
