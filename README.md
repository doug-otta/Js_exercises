## FOLLOW THE CHANNEL - CURSO EM VÍDEO - GUSTAVO GUANABARA
I used the exercises made by Gustavo Guanabara, he's a brazilian youtuber and have fantastic courses! The exercises was structured for Python, but I adapted to JavaScript, using a little bit
of CSS and HTML to show the result at the web.
And seriouly, I just solved the exercises of my own knowledge, i don't worried about best practices of JavaScript, or CSS anda HTML.
